      "It is noted as the simplest as well as the virtual limit of all stochastic processes. Thorvard Thiele was the first to mathematically model it as a Wiener process and Jan Ingenhousz observed it on the surface of alcohol. Additionally, Lucretius shed light on it in his scientific poem, \"On the Nature of Things\", citing the example of sunbeams exposing dust. The time evolution of the position of a particle undergoing this can be described by a Langevin equation. It was described by the Fokker-Planck equation and Einstein used the kinetic theory of gases to further explain it. For 10 points, what is this vibrating movement of particles in a state of matter named for a Scottish botanist? \n",

      "Vaso-occlusive crises in people with this condition can cause priapism in males, along with jaundice, paleness, fatigue, and organ damage. It comes from the pleiotropic effects of a point mutation substituting a glutamic acid for valine at position 6, causing the abnormal HbS form of hemoglobin and resulting in blockage of arteries and veins. In addition, its presence counteracts Plasmodium and the resulting effects of malaria. Found mainly in sub-Saharan Africans and their descendants, For 10 points, identify this condition which commonly causes anemia, the presence of which is marked by bent blood cells. \n",

      "There are six species of these birds, in the family Phoenicopteridae. When feeding, rows of lamellae on the edges of the bill filter water pumped through the bill for small aquatic organisms. They build cone-shaped nest mounds of mud, and breed in large colonies, as at Great Inagua in the Bahamas. Three species live on alkaline lakes in the Andes, while only one, the Greater, is found in the U.S., in southern Florida. For 10 points, name these tall birds whose diet of carotenoids gives them their pinkish color. \n",

      "The molar heat capacity for a metal is roughly equal to three times this quantity, according to the Law of Dulong and Petit. Like entropy, it is most often expressed in joules per mole Kelvin. The product of this quantity and temperature also appears in the Nernst equation. In the Arrhenius equation, the activation energy divides both this quantity and temperature. It is equal to the product of Boltzmann's constant and Avogadro's number. For 10 points, give this constant equal to about 8.31 joules per mole Kelvin, usually symbolized R. \n",

The product of this quantity and temperature also appears in the Nernst equation. In the Arrhenius equation, the activation energy divides both this quantity and temperature. It is equal to the product of Boltzmann's constant and Avogadro's number. For 10 points, give this constant equal to about 8.31 joules\n"
